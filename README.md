I am currently working on my second Git project, where the main purpose is to apply my HTML knowledge by building a recipe website. The main index page of my website will contain links to a few recipes.

Once I complete this project, I will have created a homepage, an about page, and a recipe page for my website. To make it easier for users to navigate between pages, I will include a navigation link on each page so that they don't have to click on the "back" arrow.

Aside from working on the website's front-end, I have decided to use my newly acquired Django skills to develop the back-end of the project.
