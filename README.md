This is Nkululeko's second Git project.

The purpose of the project is to take all the HTML knowledge I've garnered so far and put it into practice.
The recipe website that I am bulding in this project has a main index page with links to a few recipes.

Once the project is complete, I will have created a homepage to my website, and the about and the recipe pages.
Also, each page will have a link to easily navigate to another page without having to click on the 'back' arrow.
